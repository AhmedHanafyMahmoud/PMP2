I need to handle:
	online payment
	home has recent posts!
	
	In order pages have buttons to 
		refresh:status updated to cancel or expired automatically every day
		paid, unpaid, all

	<li class="active"> for navbar

	JS tasks:
		label for total price 
		not sure if we need thatcheckbox to confirm order
